During the daily work, an employee may be exposed to information that is considered strictly 
confidential. This information should not be discussed with anybody, including; other employees, 
trade members, vendors, family and friends.  
 
Information exclusively termed “Confidential” needs to be maintained at all times in 
Folders/Envelopes clearly marked “CONFIDENTIAL”. The folder also needs to carry the 
name/designation of the person in whose custody it rests and who can access it (in case  of conditional 
access). Extremely confidential Information like Personnel Files and Financial Details need to be 
maintained in locked cupboard/safe. The keys to be in the custody of the Director General or any 
competent authority. Disclosure of confidenti al information (willfully or otherwise) is a serious 
offence and strict disciplinary action will be initiated against employees found guilty.
