c. Retirement  from  Services : An Employee  will retire  from  the services  of the Council  on 
attaining  the retirement  age of 60. All applicable  dues would  be paid  to him  on his/her 
retirement and dues if any will be recovered from his full & final settlement.  
d. Voluntary  Abandonment  of Services :  
An Employee  who  absents  himself/herself  for 21 calendar  days  in a row  or more  or 
extends  leave  without  notification/authorization  will be termed  as having  voluntarily  
abandoned  or relinquished  lien on employment  with  the Council . The Council  shall  deem  
such  automatic  relinquishment  of lien on employment as repudiation of contract by 
Employee and not as termination of services.  Employeeâ€™s name will be taken off the 
Council  payroll. HR will follow due process in ensuring  that  the delinquent  Employee  is 
given  sufficient  opportunity  to represent  his/her  case.  The Council  is not liable to  pay any 
notice  pay to such  employees.
