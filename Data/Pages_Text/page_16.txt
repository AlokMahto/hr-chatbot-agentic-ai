a. Internal  Memo : Written  warning  will be issued  by the superior  to the 
employee  for any misconduct communicating  not to  repeat  the same  mistake  
/ misconduct.  
 
b. First  Written  Warning:  If a serious  breach  of discipline  is committed,  or an 
offence  is repeatedly  committed despite earlier verbal warnings, or conduct 
does not meet standards acceptable to  CHEMEXCIL , a first written warning 
will be given. A copy of the warning will be kept in the  employee’s  personnel  
file. 
c. Final Written Warning: If there is a significant breach  of discipline which is 
insufficiently  serious to justify dismissal or if following a first written warning 
there is failure to improve and/ or further  misconduct, final written warning 
will be given to the employee. This will give reason, the  improvement required 
and the time  scale, if any, for improvement. It will warn that dismissal will  
result  if there  is further  misconduct.  A copy  of the warning  will be kept  in the 
employee’s  personnel  file. 
d. Dismissal without Notice (summary dismissal):  Dismissal procedures will 
be initiated as per the prevalent Labor Law. In circumstances where the 
management believes that gross misconduct has  occurred, the penalty will 
normally be summary dismissal without notice. This decision may jointly be 
taken by the Director General , in consultation with the Chairman .
